ThreadGroups are a way of having multiple threads in a single unit
This is good for controlling, monitoring, and managing multiple threads together
For threadGroups we can perform the same task on a group of the threads instead

When creating a new thread we can specify to which threadgroup it belongs to 

activeCount() / enumerate() / interrupt() are some of the methods that could be used along
